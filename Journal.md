# 6/25/25 Day 1
Came up with the intial idea and started cad

Chose the BTT manta E3EZ since I have experience with it, It dosen't need a seperate board to run klipper since it supports the CB1 and CM4, and it fulfills all my needs for Pronto.

Decied on a size for the base and the control board that I am going to use (BTT Manta E3EZ) then started the base and will finish it in the morning becase it is 2 am (30 minutes)

# 7/17/25 Day 2 Continued part sourcing and a little cad


### - Extruder

Decied on the HGX lite 2.0 extruder because from what i have seen it is a relible and powerfull extruder that will be just what i need for this project.

### - Rails

I decied on MGN9H rails and blocks because they are light weight and since i am only using 250mm rails then they will be strong enough for this applicaton, they are also relirvly inexpesive. proving a cost effective solution for the gantry.

### - Hotend

I chose the Mellow NF Zone V6 hotend because it is an inexpesive, reliable, and effective hotend capible of temps up to 500C and containing an all metal heatbreak makes this a good solution for the hotend.

(Spent 4 hours researching parts)

Continued on the base and mounted the first of 7 linear rails (1 hour)
