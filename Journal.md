Came up with the intial idea and started cad

Chose the BTT manta E3EZ since I have experience with it, It dosen't need a seperate board to run klipper since it supports the CB1 and CM4, and it fulfills all my needs for Pronto.

Decied on a size for the base and the control board that I am going to use (BTT Manta E3EZ) then started the base and will finish it in the morning becase it is 2 am (30 minutes)
